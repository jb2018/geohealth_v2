What is geohealth

Geohealth brings together giscience and health so that we can better understand factors influencing the spatial patterns emerging of particular health or disease occurrences. The aim of this is to provide comprehensive knowledge and skillsets to critique and address a range of global health issues. Students will be introduced to a variety of topics and concepts centred around how geo-spatial information and technologies can be used for addressing health and disease. Three main facets of public health will be covered: health risk – understanding where and when risks are and who may be affected; health response & services – examining accessibility to healthcare and inequalities; and health communication & decision making – communicating risks and the role of digital information and tools in providing information and aiding the decision-making process that includes data structures and ethics.
